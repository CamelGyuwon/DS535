The original github repository is [here](https://github.com/yiyanxu/diffrec)

## Environment
- Anaconda 3
- python 3.8.10
- pytorch 1.12.0
- numpy 1.22.3
- kmeans-pytorch==0.3

## Usage
### Data
ml-1m dataset we used is in ./datasets

Since all the dataset is too big for upload please refer the [official code](https://github.com/yiyanxu/diffrec)
 
#### L-DiffRec
Our best performance is based on L-DiffRec
```
cd ./L-DiffRec
sh run_inference.sh
```
The experiment results would be saved in ./inference_logs
